          <h3>Ecma Invited Expert Form – TC39 ECMAScript</h3>
<h4>Rules for Ecma Invited Experts:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Ecma Invited Experts shall be a very small number of experts, who are needed to complete the Ecma work and whose contributions are regarded as exceptionally important. They participate free of charge in the work of a TC (including face-to-face meetings) on invitation by Ecma in an Ecma TC and may contribute to an Ecma standard.</li>
<li>With Ecma Invited Experts there is no intention whatsoever to introduce a non-paying individual membership category. Therefore Invited Experts in Ecma work should be regarded as exceptional and rare. It is encouraged that instead of Invited Experts the company / organization with whom the invited expert is affiliated with (if he has such relationship) becomes Ecma Member itself.</li>
<li>The Ecma TC decides who should be invited to participate in the work of the TC. The request goes to the Secretary General of Ecma, who may or may not issue an invitation to the Invited Expert.</li>
<li>The Invited Expert has to fill in and sign the Form annexed (This form is derived from the application form for formal Ecma memberships and is similar to the form used by TC39 RF Tg non-members contributions).</li>
<li>The Ecma Secretariat countersigns the fillied in and signed form. With that the status of the Intvited Expert is ratified and he may participate in the work of the TC.</li>
<li>This status is granted until withdrawal by the Invited Expert or the Ecma Secretariat. Yearly renewal is required. Equally the invited expert status expires when the associated TC finishes its work and closes down.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Who does not fall under this regulation (other existing categories):</h4>
<ol start=7>
<li>Observers to an Ecma TC meeting are not Invited Experts. They have no rights to contribute to an Ecma standard and also no right to vote. Observers can be admitted for one or two of meetings most, e.g. to find out if they would like to join Ecma as members, or not. They are admitted by the Secretary General in consultation with the TC Chairman. Observers will be listed in the list of participants for a TC meeting, but they do not have to fill in and sign any form to be an Observer.</li>
<li>Occasionally other participants can also participate in a TC meeting on invitation or permission by the TC chair and / or the Ecma Secretariat. A typical example for that is to report e.g. about a related standardization activity in other SDOs by a “liaison representative”, or to give a presentation about a certain technology. Such infomation shall not be regarded as “contribution” to the standard. They are admitted by the Secretary General in consultation with the TC Chairman, usually for one meeting. Such participants will be listed in the list of participants for a TC meeting, but they do not have to fill in and sign any form to.</li>
